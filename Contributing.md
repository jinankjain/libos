# Contributions Welcome

## Contribution Workflow

libvmm uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if
you want to merge your changes to libvmm:

1. Within your fork of 
   [libvmm](https://github.com/libvmm/libvmm), create a
   branch for your contribution. Use a meaningful name.
1. Create your contribution
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
   against the master branch of the libvmm repository.
1. Work with your reviewers to address any comments.  To update your pull
   request amend existing commits whenever applicable and then push the new
   changes to your pull request branch.
1. Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it.

## Request for Comments

If you just want to receive feedback for a contribution proposal, open an “RFC”
(“Request for Comments”) pull request:

1. On your fork of 
   [libvmm](https://github.com/libvmm/libvmm), create a
   branch for the contribution you want feedback on. Use a meaningful name.
1. Create your proposal based on the existing codebase.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
   against the master branch of the libvmm repository. Prefix your pull
   request name with `[RFC]`.
1. Discuss your proposal with the community on the pull request page (or on any
   other channel). Add the conclusion(s) of this discussion to the pull request
   page.

## Sign off your contributions

Submitting a pull request certifies that you wrote the patches or otherwise
have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty
simple: if you can certify the below:

### Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line saying::

	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
